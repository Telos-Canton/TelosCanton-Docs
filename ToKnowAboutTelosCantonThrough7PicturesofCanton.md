# To Know About Telos Canton Through 7 Pictures of Canton

Telos Canton would like to introduce the spiritual core of Canton (which may have been forgotten) through 7 photos from Canton. There are important elements that connect Canton to the world and may present a China that is different from your impression. The pictures also showcases how they relate to the blockchain world.  
*We updated our website with these 7 pictures: https://www.teloscanton.io

## The world is for all

"The world is for all" is the philosophy from Confucianism and now has been given new meaning in the era of the early 20th century. The world is a world of all people. This is the awakening and a spiritual revival. This idea once resonated with a group of insightful Chinese people who later established the first democratic republic in Asia. At the same time, it also fits well with the blockchain spirit.

## 2. Spirit lives forever

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Telos-Canton/TelosCanton-Docs/master/images/Canton/Huanghuagang_Mausoleum_of_Martyrs_黄花岗七十二烈士墓.jpg)

This place is probably the only Statue of Liberty in China in public places. The 72 martyrs sacrificed their young lives to national freedom, and their stories and spirit will last forever. After that, many Chinese have fought for freedom together with others around the world, although this part of history may have been forgotten by many. In some sense, we are continuing this unfinished journey with the people who guard the freedom around the world in the blockchain world.

## 3. Sino-Western fusion

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Telos-Canton/TelosCanton-Docs/master/images/Canton/Sino-Western_Fusion_中西交融.jpg)

We must first recognize our backwardness and shortcomings in order to better learn and absorb the elements of advanced civilization and to accommodate people from all over the world. Just as EOSIO's governance competition and institutional integration, only by establishing a system that can constantly correct itself can we achieve true prosperity.

## 4. The heart of the craftsman

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Telos-Canton/TelosCanton-Docs/master/images/Canton/Heart_of_Traditional_Craftsmen_传统匠人之心.jpg)

Focusing on one thing, one mind, one action, day after day, repeat and repeat thousands of times, only for the pursuit of progress bit by bit. This is the spirit and the heart of the craftsman. This spirit applies to all areas, including the building of an excellent public blockchain network.

## 5. Scholarly Family

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Telos-Canton/TelosCanton-Docs/master/images/Canton/Scholarly_Family_书香门弟.jpg)

Emphasizing education has always been our tradition. It is a universal belief that education can change people's destiny. Developers and community members need to constantly learn and build a platform that helps people systematically and continuously learn all kinds of knowledge about Telos. It is our important task.

## 6. Five Goats with Grain

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Telos-Canton/TelosCanton-Docs/master/images/Canton/The_statue_of_five_goats_in_Catnon_五羊雕像.jpg)

This legendary statue symbolizes a good harvest, peace, hard work and yearning for a better life. It reminds us of the ultimate purpose of our ongoing efforts - human happiness. Institutional design, technological research, applied innovation, and everything in the blockchain are just tools but not ultimate goals. We always remind ourselves that human happiness is our pursuit. We will always move toward this goal. Do not focus solely on the means and overlook the purpose. Do not deviate from the direction.

## 7. Kapok

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Telos-Canton/TelosCanton-Docs/master/images/Canton/City_Flower_of_Canton_广州市花.jpg)

Independence, pragmatism, dedication, perseverance, and integrity - the spirit of Kapok symbolizes our adherence to quality. No matter how advanced technology and systems are, they are run by people. We pursue the use of technology to minimize the impact of people, but people are always the most important influence. Therefore, we must commit to our words and deeds and strictly abide by it in order to effectively maintain the security and stability of the public blockchain network.

## One question

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Telos-Canton/TelosCanton-Docs/master/images/Libra.Vote-Logo-200X200.png)

We often think about a question: despite the rich and good spiritual core we have always possessed, why did we only make relatively limited contributions to the world during the time of modern Chinese history, and yet have left some bad impressions on the world during the contemporary time? Of course, history and reality are complex, things have its multifaceted nature (achievement and problems coexist), and development has its own stage (there are inevitable problems), which can not be simply explained in a few words.
However, if the technology and governance model of the blockchain can make the world more fair and creative, can it help us to regain the fine traditions, remove bad burdens, and make more and greater contributions to the world? Telos Canton hopes to achieve this through action.

## One explanation

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Telos-Canton/TelosCanton-Docs/master/images/telos-canton-logo-slogan-200X200.png)

Before the establishment of Telos Canton, community members made a lot of suggestions for the naming of our BP. One of the suggestions is that the blockchain is borderless and belongs to all mankind. It does not have to be geographically distinctive. Undoubtedly this view is very reasonable, but in the end we chose "Canton" (Guangzhou) for the following reasons:
1. Easier to be identified by  local and so as to better our service and support;
2. Diversified cultural integration stimulates creativity and helps people understand this colorful world;
3. Exploring the ingredients that are beneficial to the world from the local culture, and combining the traditional good ideas with the concept of blockchain.
4. Replacing the official "GuangZhou" with "Canton". In addition to the long history of the name "Canton", we hope to show the unique and beautiful side of "Yue culture" (Different from Mandarin).

We hope the above information will help you to know more about Telos Canton.

# 透過廣州的七個畫面瞭解 Telos Canton

Telos Canton 將通過7張來自廣州的照片，嘗試讓您瞭解廣州（可能已經被遺忘）的精神內核，其中更有它聯接世界的重要元素，可能會讓你接觸到一個與你印象不一樣的中國。同時也向您展示它們與區塊鏈世界的聯繫。
*篇幅關係，這裡不作具體歷史事件和人物的描述。
*我們以這7張照片更新了官網：https://www.teloscanton.io

## 1. 天下為公

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Telos-Canton/TelosCanton-Docs/master/images/Canton/The_World_Is_For_All_%E5%A4%A9%E4%B8%8B%E4%B8%BA%E5%85%AC.jpg)

“天下為公”這個來自儒家的傳統思想，在20世紀初的中國被賦予了另一層時代的意義——世界是所有人的世界，這是一種覺醒，同時也是一種精神回溯。這個思想曾經號召了一群中國的有識之士，建立了亞洲第一個民主共和國。同時，它也和區塊鏈精神非常契合。

## 2. 浩氣長存

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Telos-Canton/TelosCanton-Docs/master/images/Canton/Huanghuagang_Mausoleum_of_Martyrs_黄花岗七十二烈士墓.jpg)

這個地方很可能是中國在公共場所唯一僅有的自由女神像。72位烈士為民族自由付出了年輕的生命，他們的故事和精神將永存於天下之間。而在他們之後的中國，曾與世界其他守護自由的人們一同為自由而戰，但這段歷史可能已經被很多人所遺忘。在某種意義上，我們在區塊鏈世界中也正和世界各地守護自由的人們繼續這段尚未完成的旅程。

## 3. 中西交融

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Telos-Canton/TelosCanton-Docs/master/images/Canton/Sino-Western_Fusion_中西交融.jpg)

我們要先承認自己的落後和不足，才能更好地學習和吸收先進文明的元素，並包容來自各地的人們。正如EOSIO的治理競爭和制度交融，只有建立出能不斷自我修正系統，才能走向真正的繁榮。

## 4. 匠人之心

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Telos-Canton/TelosCanton-Docs/master/images/Canton/Heart_of_Traditional_Craftsmen_传统匠人之心.jpg)

日復一日的磨練，全身心專注於一件事，一門心思，一個動作，千次萬次的重複又重複，只為追求一滴一滴的進步，這就是匠人精神，匠人之心。這種精神適用於所有領域，包括打造一條優秀的公鏈。

## 5. 書香門第

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Telos-Canton/TelosCanton-Docs/master/images/Canton/Scholarly_Family_书香门弟.jpg)

重視教育一直是我們的傳統，教育能改變人命運是放之四海佳准的道理。開發者和社區成員都需要不斷學習，建立一個套幫助人們系統地持續學習 Telos 各類知識的平臺，是我們的重要任務。

## 6. 五羊含穗

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Telos-Canton/TelosCanton-Docs/master/images/Canton/The_statue_of_five_goats_in_Catnon_五羊雕像.jpg)

這個帶有傳說的雕像象徵豐收、祥和、勤勞和對美好生活的嚮往。它提醒我們，我們一直努力的最終目的是什麼——人的幸福感。制度設計、技術研究、應用創新和區塊鏈的一切，它們只是手段而不是最終的目的。我們時刻提醒自己，人的幸福才是我們的追求，永遠朝著這個目標前行，不要過於追求手段而忽視目的，不要偏離方向。

## 7. 木棉花開

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Telos-Canton/TelosCanton-Docs/master/images/Canton/City_Flower_of_Canton_广州市花.jpg)

獨立、務實、奉獻、堅毅、頂天立地——木棉花象徵的精神，也是我們堅守品質。無論技術和制度如何先進，它都是由人去運行的，我們追求通過技術儘量降低人的影響，但人永遠都是最重要的影響。所以，我們必須要有對自己的言行作出承諾，並嚴格遵守它，才能有效維護公鏈的安全和穩定。

## 一個問題
我們經常思考一個問題，為什麼我們有如此豐富和優秀的精神內核，但近代給世界帶來的貢獻卻非常有限，而現代很多方面卻給世界留下了諸多不良的印象？當然，歷史和現實是複雜的，事物有它的多面性（成就與問題並存），發展有其階段性（存在不可避免的問題），不是三言兩語所能道明。如果區塊鏈的技術和治理模式能使這個世界更加公平和富有創造力，那麼它能否幫助我們重拾這些優良的傳統，除去不良的包袱，為這個世界作出更多更大的貢獻？但如果我們只停留在思考的階段，就永遠不會有答案，所以，Telos Canton 希望能通過行動去實現它。

## 一個解答
在 Telos Canton 成立之前，社區成員為我們的節點命名提出了很多建議。其中一個建議是——區塊鏈是無國界的，是屬於全人類的，不必特顯地域。無疑這個觀點是很有道理的，但最終我們還是選擇了“Canton”（廣州）作為節點的名字，有如下理由：
1. 便於當地和就近地區使用者識別，更好地提供服務和支援；
2. 多元的文化交融有利於激發創造力，也有助於人們瞭解這個豐富多彩的世界；
3. 從本土文化中發掘對世界有益的成份，用傳統的優良思想結合區塊鏈的理念，能更好的傳播和推廣。
4. 以“Canton”代替官方的“GuangZhou”，除了因為“Canton”這個名稱具有悠久的歷史傳承外，更希望藉此展示“粵文化”的獨特而美麗的一面。

希望通過上述內容能讓你更多的瞭解 Telos Canton。
